# Swipe-zine
Experimental media. An underground zine packaged in a single HTML file. Some kind of art.


🌀 Swipe-zine

Swipe-zine is a portable digital mini-gallery.
Each issue is a single HTML file you can swipe left or right in your browser — on a phone or desktop.
No platforms, no apps, no dependencies — everything is embedded directly into the code.

📦 How to get it
```
git clone https://github.com/ta0ma0/Swipe-zine.git
```

Then open any HTML file inside an issue folder — for example:
```
issue-01/Swipe-zine.html
```

in your browser (mobile or desktop).
That’s it — the zine works locally and completely offline.

⚙️ Autonomy & experiments

Swipe-zine is made for technically creative people.
Be inventive:

- ✴️ Subscribe via ATOM/RSS to follow new releases

- ⚡ Write your own update scripts (cron, bash, Python, etc.)

- 🤖 For the hardcore — implement automatic fetching of new issues on Android

- 🧠 Share your ideas for improving or expanding the format

🧩 Make your own zine

Create forks and build your own mini-magazines.
Swipe-zine is an open format, not a platform.
One HTML file — infinite possible stories.
